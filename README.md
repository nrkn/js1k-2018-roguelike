# js1k-2018-roguelike

Add from top to bottom until we run out of bytes or patience

- decent dungeons that look like dungeons
- monsters and combat
- multiple dungeon levels with difficulty progression
- healing potions
- win if reach bottom
- multiple monster types
- weapons/armor
- move up and down stairs
- win if reach bottom and return to top
- gold
- shop (level 0) - only fun if weight limit on carrying items and can sell then
  use money to buy better armour, weapons

Really needs inventory/shop to be a decent if minimal roguelike, but seems 
unlikely in 1K
