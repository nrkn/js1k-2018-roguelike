# js1k-2018-roguelike

Add from top to bottom until we run out of bytes or patience

- ~~decent dungeons that look like dungeons~~
- ~~monsters and combat~~
- ~~multiple dungeon levels with difficulty progression~~
- ~~healing potions~~
- ~~win if reach bottom~~
- ~~fov~~
- move up **and** down stairs
- multiple monster types
- emoji
- colors
- weapons/armor
- win if reach bottom and return to top
- gold
- shop (level 0) - only fun if weight limit on carrying items and can sell then
  use money to buy better armour, weapons

Really needs inventory/shop to be a decent if minimal roguelike, but seems 
unlikely in 1K
